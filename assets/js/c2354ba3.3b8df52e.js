An instance could be Police Patrolling at remote places. Police officers are assigned duties to patrol different areas, which might be far away from the police station. There is no way to track whether the assigned officer actually reached the location or not. A simple solution to this is GPS tracking, but only GPS tracking can be spoofed via simple mechanisms like sending your phone to the assigned location via a co-worker. Moreover, adding only face recognition to the GPS tracking can also be cheated by using picture of the concerned individual. In standard scenarios, this is overcome via using retina scan, depth detection and other sophisticated technologies, but these require specialzied hardwares which one can\u2019t expect in each and every mobile phone.
